title: Hapagirl Knitting
---

The short version: I'm a historian with a past life in Web site design and management and a passion for even more history, knitting and gymnastics, though the order is variable. I’m a process knitter, but I also have a strong product-knitter streak, which means I’m very picky about the things I knit that aren’t specifically intended for publication.

A prodigal-daughter Portland native, I spent almost 15 years in Southern California, returned home to great parental rejoicing, and then left again after 4 years to for the midwest.
