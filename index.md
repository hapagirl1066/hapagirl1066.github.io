I'm a medieval historian with a past life in Web site design and management, a present life in digital history, and a passion for even more history, knitting and gymnastics, though the order is variable. I’m a process knitter, but I also have a strong product-knitter streak, which means I’m very picky about the things I knit that aren’t specifically intended for publication.

A prodigal-daughter Portland native, I spent almost 15 years in Southern California, returned home to great parental rejoicing, and then left again after 4 years for the Midwest, which I now call home.
