This white-on-white short-sleeve sweater was designed for Yahaira Ferreira’s Pure Knits collection. Its sheer chevron center panel is a graceful counterpoint to the simple stockinette shaping in the rest of the sweater body.

The idea came from ShibuiKnits’ yarn line, in which the yarns are color-matched to blend across the whole line regardless of gauge or fiber composition.
