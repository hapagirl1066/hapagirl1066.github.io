shortdesc: "The onset of colder weather and the icy blue of this yarn inspired a lace snow-flurry that sweeps up the instep of this toe-up sock and then blows around the ankle in a spiral cuff. The forked heel means this ankle sock will stay put, thanks to the extra heel room and more anatomically correct shape. An optional ribbed cuff can be added."
