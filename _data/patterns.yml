- title: "Mistaken Identity Hat & Scarf"
  desc: "Mistake rib creates a warm, elastic fabric and highlights the beautiful shifting colors of hand-dyed yarn. A top-down slouchy hat using EZ’s basic Pi ratio makes for a nice technique change. Bonus? You can make the hat in a day. Nothing better than a quick knit for a satisfying winter project."
  blurb: "Sometimes mistakes make the best final products. The pattern got its name because no fewer than 6 hats and 2 scarves were frogged in service of finding the perfect pattern for this yarn."

- title: "Spiraling Snow Socks"
  desc: "The onset of colder weather and the icy blue of this yarn inspired a lace snow-flurry that sweeps up the instep of this toe-up sock and then blows around the ankle in a spiral cuff. The forked heel means this ankle sock will stay put, thanks to the extra heel room and more anatomically correct shape. An optional ribbed cuff can be added."
