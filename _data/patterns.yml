- title: "Mistaken Identity Hat & Scarf"
  desc: "Mistake rib creates a warm, elastic fabric and highlights the beautiful shifting colors of hand-dyed yarn. A top-down slouchy hat using EZ’s basic Pi ratio makes for a nice technique change. Bonus? You can make the hat in a day. Nothing better than a quick knit for a satisfying winter project."
  blurb: "Sometimes mistakes make the best final products. The pattern got its name because no fewer than 6 hats and 2 scarves were frogged in service of finding the perfect pattern for this yarn."

- title: "Spiraling Snow Socks"
  desc: "The onset of colder weather and the icy blue of this yarn inspired a lace snow-flurry that sweeps up the instep of this toe-up sock and then blows around the ankle in a spiral cuff. The forked heel means this ankle sock will stay put, thanks to the extra heel room and more anatomically correct shape. An optional ribbed cuff can be added."
  blurb: "Designed for Three Irish Girls’ Sock Club in Kells Sport."
