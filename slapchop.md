# The goal

To create a full spectrum of white-to-dark areas on a mini using only grayscale. Other tutorials will call this "creating volume" or making the mini's receding areas look more recessed and making the mini's convex areas protrude more visually.

# The advantages

1. This dark/light undercoat provides a canvas over which translucent colors can be layered. Because the shading is already there, the translucent color wash will take on the shading, making the application of color easier.
1. Because there are often areas of darker gray or black between spots on the mini where two colors will overlap, you can hide the overlap of those colors in the recessed darker-shaded areas, and the color changes will look neater and better-applied even if they're not really. (At least compared to using contrast paints over a light base, or using standard opaque paints over a gray primel)

# Process

1. Prime in black
1. Add ligher grayscale shading by dry-brushing from the top of the model toward the bottom of the model to mimic a light source from above. I like to do 3 coats:
	1. A controlled, but heavier, dry-brush coat using a 50% gray shade that covers a good portion of the black (maybe 15-25% of the black prime will still show)
	1. A controlled, but lighter, coat of standard-thickness white. Again, maybe 15-25% of the gray drybrush layer will show
	1. A lighter dry brush of super-dense white acrylic to get the highlights on the mini to really pop

# Assess Your Preferences.

A mini with more white on it will show the full range of the translucent colors. The color layer on a mini with less white on it might be muddier than you're likely to want.

1. Dp a test run first.
	1. Get 3 identical minis and apply the white layers of the undercoat more heavily to the second mini and then even more heavily to the 3rd mini.
	1. Take photos of each mini and all 3 together. 
	1. Apply your translucent color layers identically
	1. Look at the minis in your playing environment, not your painting environment, and decide what your preferences are
		1. Do you like an emphasis on dramatic shading (and potentially muddier colors?
		1. Do you like an emphasis on clarity of color (and potentially the need to add back a little shading at the end).
1. Dry-brushing down on the model will likely not help "volumize" (or make visible) all the details on the sides and undersides of the model. Brushing sideways to bring out some of the detail underneath arms or on stomachs or inside the mouths of a model with the gray and first white coat can help bring out the model's shape without diminishing the "light source from the top" effect that underpainting offers. Stay at or above a 90-degree angle to the imagined light source with the direction of your brush strokes.

# Lava and Glowing-Light effects

If you have a mini that is clearly intended to be a lava monster or have or glowing-light effects, reverse the process.

Start with a white primer, and shade in gray and black, leaving some lighter colors around the edges of the area you want to glow, so that the white undercoat is clearly visible in the recessed areas.

Then you can apply color to get a variety of glowing effects. Coat the white with the brightest of your colors first (e.g. a bright translucent yellow for lava) and then dry-brush the edges with 2 successive, less-coverage-focused layers of darker colors (e.gl for lava, first translucent orange and then red). These colors will shade the black overcoat around the edges of the white recesses, giving the mini a lit-from-within effect.
