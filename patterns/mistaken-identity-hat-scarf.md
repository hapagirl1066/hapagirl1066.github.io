Sometimes mistakes make the best final products. The pattern got its name because no fewer than 6 hats and 2 scarves were frogged in service of finding the perfect pattern for this yarn.

Mistake rib creates a warm, elastic fabric and highlights the beautiful shifting colors of hand-dyed yarn. A top-down slouchy hat using EZâ€™s basic Pi ratio makes for a nice technique change.

Bonus? You can make the hat in a day. Nothing better than a quick knit for a satisfying winter project.
