This new “forked heel” will win over die-hard devotees of short-row and heel-flap techniques alike, thanks to the extra heel room and more anatomically correct shape. The forked heel helps the pattern curve around the ankle bone and gives the sock-wearer extra room at the back of the heel to help prevent excess wear and tear.

Basic 2×2 ribbing makes the sock perfect for anyone in the family and a perfect choice for anyone trying toe-up sock construction for the first time.
